<body>



This package contains classes pertaining to expressions, terms,

formulas, symbols, and other parts of the language used to express

formulas in the language.



<p>I have not decided how best to make this extensible or how best to

make it interact with the classes in the parser package so right now I

am just trying to make it work.&nbsp; I think it is fairly extensible

right now but could be a lot better.
